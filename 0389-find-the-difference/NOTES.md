Counter, which counts the occurrences of characters in both strings and then compares the counts. 
This code first creates two Counter objects for strings s and t. 
Then, it iterates through the characters in t and compares their counts in both strings. 
When it finds a character that doesn't exist in s or has a different count, it returns that character. 
This approach is more efficient and less error-prone.
